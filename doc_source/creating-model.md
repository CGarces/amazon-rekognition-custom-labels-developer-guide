# Creating an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model<a name="creating-model"></a>

A model is the software that you train to find the concepts, scenes, and objects that are unique to your business\. You can create a model with the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console or with the AWS SDK\. Before creating an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model, we recommend that you read [Understanding Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels](understanding-custom-labels.md)\. 

This section provides console and SDK information about creating a project, creating training and test datasets for different model types, and training a model\. Later sections show you how to improve and use your model\. For a tutorial that shows you how to create and use a specific type of model with the console, see [Tutorial: Classifying images](tutorial-classification.md)\.
