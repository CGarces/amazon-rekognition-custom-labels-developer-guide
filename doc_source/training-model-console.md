# Tutorial: Training a model with the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console<a name="training-model-console"></a>

These tutorials show you how to create and train an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model by using the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console\. It also shows you how to start the model and use it to detect custom labels in new images\. 

**Note**  
If you are training your model to detect object, scenes, or concepts, you don't need to do [Step 7: Locate objects with bounding boxes](tutorial-draw-bounding-boxes.md)\. Similarly, if you're training a model to detect the location of objects in an image, you don't need to do [Step 6: Identify objects, scenes and concepts with image\-level labels](tutorial-add-image-labels.md)\.
