After you finished trying the examples projects, you can use your own images and datasets to create your own model\. For more information, see [Understanding Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels](understanding-custom-labels.md)\.

Use the labeling information in the following table to train models similar to the example projects\.


| Example | Training images | Test images | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Image classification \(Rooms\)  |  1 Image\-level label per image  |  1 Image\-level label per image   | 
|  Multi\-label classification \(Flowers\)  |  Multiple image\-level labels per image  |  Multiple image\-level labels per image  | 
|  Brand detection \(Logos\)  |  image level\-labels \(you can also use Labeled bounding boxes\)  |  Labeled bounding boxes  | 
|  Image localization \(Circuit boards\)  |  Labeled bounding boxes  |  Labeled bounding boxes  | 

The [Tutorial: Classifying images](tutorial-classification.md) shows you how to create a project, datasets, and models for an Image classification model\.
