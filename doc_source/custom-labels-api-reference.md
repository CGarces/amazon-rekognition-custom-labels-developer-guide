# Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels API reference<a name="custom-labels-api-reference"></a>

The Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels API is documented as part of the Amazon Rekognition API reference content\. This is a list of the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels API operations with links to the appropriate Amazon Rekognition API reference topic\. Also, API reference links within this document go to the appropriate Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide API reference topic\. For information about using the API, see [ Understanding Amazon Rekognition Custom LabelsUnderstanding Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels  This section gives you an overview of the workflow to train and use an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model with the console and the AWS SDK\. Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels now manages datasets within a project\. You can create datasets for your projects with the console and with the AWS SDK\. If you have previously used Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels, your older datasets might need associating with a new project\. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Step 7: Associate prior datasets with new projects](su-associate-prior-dataset.md)    Decide your model type  You first decide which type of model you want to train, which depends on your business goals\. For example, you could train a model to find your logo in social media posts, identify your products on store shelves, or classify machine parts in an assembly line\.  Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels can train the following types of model:  [Find objects, scenes, and concepts](#tm-classification) [Find object locations](#tm-object-localization) [Find the location of brands](#tm-brand-detection-localization)  To help you decide which type of model to train, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels provides example projects that you can use\. For more information, see [Getting started with Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels](getting-started.md)\.    Find objects, scenes, and concepts  The model predicts objects, scenes, and concepts associated with an entire image\. For example, you can train a model that determines if an image contains a *tourist attraction*, or not\.  

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/images/pateros.jpg) Alternatively, you can train a model that categorizes images into multiple categories\. For example, the previous image might have categories such as *sky color*, *reflection*, or *lake*\. The [Image classification](getting-started.md#gs-image-classification-example) and [Multi\-label image classification](getting-started.md#gs-multi-label-image-classification-example) example projects show different uses for image\-level labels\.     Find object locations  The model predicts the location of an object on an image\. The prediction includes bounding box information for the object location and a label that identifies the object within the bounding box\. For example, the following image shows bounding boxes around various parts of a circuit board, such as a *comparator* or *pot resistor*\.  

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/images/localization-circuit-board.png) The [Object localization](getting-started.md#gs-object-localization-example) example project shows how Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels uses labeled bounding boxes to train a model that finds object locations\.     Find the location of brands  Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels can train a model that finds the location of brands, such as logos, on an image\. The prediction includes bounding box information for the brand location and a label that identifies the object within the bounding box\.  

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/images/brand-detection-lambda.png)        Create a model  The steps to create a model are creating a project, creating training and test datasets, and training the model\.   Create a project  An Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project is a group of resources needed to create and manage a model\. A project manages the following:  **Datasets** – The images and image labels used to train a model\. A project has a training dataset and a test dataset\.  **Models** – The software that you train to find the concepts, scenes, and objects unique to your business\. You can have multiple versions of a model in a project\.    We recommend that you use a project for a single use case, such as finding circuit board parts on a circuit board\. You can create a project with the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console and with the [CreateProject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_CreateProject) API\. For more information, see [Creating a project](mp-create-project.md)\.     Create training and test datasets  A dataset is a set of images and labels that describe those images\. Within your project, you create a training dataset and a test dataset that Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels uses to train and test your model\. A label identifies an object, scene, concept, or bounding box around an object in an image\. Labels are either assigned to an entire image \(*image\-level*\) or they are assigned to a bounding box that surrounds an object on an image\.  How you label the images in your datasets determines the type of model that Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels creates\. For example, to train a model that finds objects, scenes and concepts, you assign image level labels to the images in your training and test datasets\. For more information, see [Purposing datasets](md-dataset-purpose.md)\.  Images must be in PNG and JPEG format, and you should follow the input images recommendations\. For more information, see [Preparing images](md-prepare-images.md)\.   Create training and test datasets \(Console\)   You can start a project with a single dataset, or with separate training and test datasets\. If you start with a single dataset, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels splits your dataset during training to create a training dataset \(80%\) and a test dataset \(20%\) for your project\. Start with a single dataset if you want Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels to decide which images are used for training and testing\. For complete control over training, testing, and performance tuning, we recommend that you start your project with separate training and test datasets\.  To create the datasets for a project, you import the images in one of the following ways:  Import images from your local computer\. Import images from an S3 bucket\. Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels can label the images using the folder names that contain the images\.  Import an Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth manifest file\. Copy an existing Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels dataset\.  For more information, see [Creating training and test datasets \(Console\)](md-create-dataset.md)\. Depending on where you import your images from, your images might be unlabeled\. For example, images imported from a local computer aren't labeled\. Images imported from an Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth manifest file are labeled\. You can use the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console to add, change, and assign labels\. For more information, see [Labeling images](md-labeling-images.md)\. To create your training and test datasets with the console, see [Creating training and test datasets \(Console\)](md-create-dataset.md)\. For a tutorial that includes creating training and test datasets, see [Tutorial: Classifying images](tutorial-classification.md)\.   Create training and test datasets \(SDK\)   To create your training and test datasets, you use the `CreateDataset` API\.  You can create a dataset by using an Amazon Sagemaker format manifest file or by copying an existing Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels dataset\. For more information, see [Create training and test datasets \(SDK\) ](cd-create-dataset-sdk.md) If necessary, you can create your own manifest file\. For more information, see [Creating a manifest file](md-create-manifest-file.md)\.    Train your model  Train your model with the training dataset\. A new version of a model is created each time it is trained\. Training also evaluates your model by using the test dataset\. Training takes a while to complete\. You are only charged for a successful model training\. For more information, see [Training an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model](training-model.md)\. If model training fails, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels provides debugging information that you can use\. For more information, see [Debugging a failed model training](tm-debugging.md)\.   Train your model \(Console\)  To train your model with the console, see [Training a model \(Console\)](training-model.md#tm-console)\.   Training a model \(SDK\)   You train an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model by calling [CreateProjectVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_CreateProjectVersion)\.     Improve your model  You can use evaluation metrics to help improve your trained model\.  Evaluate your model  Evaluate the performance of your model by using the performance metrics created during testing\. Performance metrics, such as F1, precision, and recall, allow you to understand the performance of your trained model, and decide if you're ready to use it in production\. For more information, see [Metrics for evaluating your model](im-metrics-use.md)\.  Evaluate a model \(console\)  To view performance metrics, see [Accessing training results \(Console\)](im-access-training-results.md)\.    Evaluate a model \(SDK\)  To get performance metrics, you call [DescribeProjectVersions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_DescribeProjectVersions) to get the training results\. For more information, see [Accessing Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels training results \(SDK\)](im-metrics-api.md)\. The training results include metrics not available in the console, such as a confusion matrix for classification results\. The training results are returned in the following formats:   F1 score – A single value representing the overall performance of precision and recall for the model\. For more information, see [F1](im-metrics-use.md#im-f1-metric)\. Summary file location – The training summary includes aggregated evaluation metrics for the entire testing dataset and metrics for each individual label\. `DescribeProjectVersions` returns the S3 bucket and folder location of the summary file\. For more information, see [Summary file](im-summary-file-api.md)\. Evaluation manifest snapshot location – The snapshot contains details about the test results, including the confidence ratings and the results of binary classification tests, such as false positives\. `DescribeProjectVersions` returns the S3 bucket and folder location of the snapshot files\. For more information, see [Evaluation manifest snapshot](im-evaluation-manifest-snapshot-api.md)\.      Improve your model  If improvements are needed, you can add more training images or improve dataset labeling\. For more information, see [Improving an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model](tr-improve-model.md)\. You can also give feedback on the predictions your model makes and use it to make improvements to your model\. For more information, see [Model feedback solution](ex-feedback.md)\.  Improve your model \(console\)  To add images to a dataset, see [Adding more images to a dataset](md-add-images.md)\. To add or change labels, see [Labeling images](md-labeling-images.md)\. To retrain your model, see [Training a model \(Console\)](training-model.md#tm-console)\.   Improve your model \(SDK\)  To add images to a dataset or change the labeling for an image, use the `UpdateDatasetEntries` API\. `UpdateDatasetEntries` updates or adds JSON lines to a manifest file\. Each JSON line contains information for a single image, such as assigned labels or bounding box information\. For more information, see [Adding more images \(SDK\)](md-add-images.md#md-add-images-sdk)\. To view the entries in a dataset, use the `ListDatasetEntries` API\. To retrain your model, see [Training a model \(SDK\)](training-model.md#tm-sdk-datasets)\.     Start your model  Before you can use your model, you start the model by using the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console or the `StartProjectVersion` API\. You are charged for the amount of time that your model runs\. For more information, see [Running a trained Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model](running-model.md)\.   Start your model \(console\)  To start your model using the console, see [Starting an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model \(Console\)](rm-start.md#rm-start-console)\.   Start your model  You start your model calling [StartProjectVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_StartProjectVersion)\. For more information, see [Starting an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model \(SDK\)](rm-start.md#rm-start-sdk)\.     Analyze an image  To analyze an image with your model, you use the `DetectCustomLabels` API\. You can specify a local image, or an image stored in an S3 bucket\. The operation also requires the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the model that you want to use\.  If your model finds objects, scenes, and concepts, the response includes a list of image\-level labels found in the image\. For example, the following image shows the image\-level labels found using *Rooms* example project\. 

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/images/rooms.jpg) If the model finds object locations, the response includes list of labeled bounding boxes found in the image\. A bounding box represents the location of an object on an image\. You can use the bounding box information to draw a bounding box around an object\. For example, the following image shows bounding boxes around circuit board parts found using the *Circuit boards* example project\. 

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/images/circuitboardparts.jpg) For more information, see [Analyzing an image with a trained model](detecting-custom-labels.md)\.    Stop your model  You are charged for the time that your model is running\. If you are no longer using your model, stop the model by using the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console, or by using the `StopProjectVersion` API\. For more information, see [Stopping an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model](rm-stop.md)\.   Stop your model \(SDK\)  To stop a running model with the console, see [Stopping an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model \(Console\)](rm-stop.md#rm-stop-console)\.
