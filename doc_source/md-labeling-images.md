# Labeling images<a name="md-labeling-images"></a>

A label identifies an object, scene, concept, or bounding box around an object in an image\. For example, if your dataset contains images of dogs, you might add labels for breeds of dogs\. 

After importing your images into a dataset, you might need to add labels to images or correct mislabeled images\. For example, images aren't labeled if they are imported from a local computer\. You use the dataset gallery to add new labels to the dataset and assign labels and bounding boxes to images in the dataset\. 

How you label the images in your datasets determines the type of model that Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels trains\. For more information, see [Purposing datasets](md-dataset-purpose.md)\.
